			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Antibiotics are typically thought of as chemicals that kill bacteria. However, the name antibiotic really refers to anything that kills or interferes with the growth and reproduction of any organism: viruses, bacteria, plants, insects, etc. Nonetheless, weâ€™ll adopt the convention that antibiotics are chemicals that disrupt key biological processes of bacteria and use more specific names for other chemicals that target other kinds of organisms: fungicides are chemicals that target fungi; herbicides target plants; pesticides typically target insects; and antiviral drugs are specific for viruses. All of these antibiotics represent strong agents of selection against organisms.</p>
			<p>People use an <a href = "#figure1" data-toggle = "modal">enormous amount of antibiotics, fungicides, herbicides and pesticides annually</a> to promote health and agricultural productivity. Monitoring of the Mississippi River from 1993-1997 revealed as much as 1250 tons of herbicides were discharged annually, mostly concentrated during the growing season. Moreover, the fraction of agricultural land subject to some kind of herbicide has increased steadily over the years, although the particular chemical used <a href = "#figure2" data-toggle = "modal">varies</a>. Similarly, in the United States about 40 million pounds of antibiotics are sold annually, most of which is used to promote the agricultural productivity of <a href ="#figure3" data-toggle = "modal">chickens, turkeys, pigs, and cows</a>. Astonishingly, more than 700 products marketed for homes have anti-bacterial chemicals. It should hardly come as a surprise, then, that the domain with the shortest generational time on the planet has found new uses for that which used to kill it. Many bacteria actually feed on antibiotics: in studies where antibiotics were provided as the only carbon source, bacteria grew and chemical analysis revealed that they <a href="#figure4" data-toggle ="modal">digested the antibiotics</a> and used the carbon for growth. For some bacteria, therapeutic treatment can make the problem worse. For others, it's only a matter of time: studies show that <a href="#table1" data-toggle ="modal">most antibiotics succumb to resistance</a> when bacteria are given prolonged exposure. To make matters worse (for us), a particular bacterial cell may be resistant to more than one antibiotic. For example, a <a href="#figure5" data-toggle ="modal">survey of bacteria</a> isolated from soils revealed that, of the bacteria that were antibiotic resistance, all were resistant to two or more antibiotics, most were resistant to seven antibiotics, and some isolates were resistant to as many as 15 different antibiotics. 
			</p>

			<h3>An Evolutionary Perspective</h3>
			<p>
			Antibiotic resistance originates by random mutation. A resistance mutation did not happen because the cell needed it to survive. Instead, a mutation happened somewhere in a gene that conferred some degree of resistance to an antibiotic BEFORE the antibiotic was present in the environment and this particular cell was able to survive in an environment with antibiotics. In the environment without antibiotics, this potential resistance mutant was most likely deleterious because it messed up some aspect of the biology of the cell. Interestingly, the vast majority of resistance mutations begin as deleterious mutations. This makes sense given that the <a href="#figure6" data-toggle ="modal"> probability distribution</a> for the fitness effects of mutations shows that deleterious mutations are overwhelmingly the most frequent type of mutation.
			</p>
			<p>A second important piece of the puzzle is that within a given population of bacteria, there are enormous numbers of different alleles that exist at very low frequency because they are new mutants. Consider, for instance, the bacteria in your gut. There are probably tens to hundreds of billions of bacteria living inside the human gut. Let's imagine there are 10,000,000,000 bacterial cells for a particular species. The spontaneous mutation rate for bacteria is approximately 10-9 at each nucleotide site in a gene in a single bacterial generation. If you multiply 10,000,000,000 by 0.000000001, you get the number of alleles that exist for a particular gene due to a change at a single base; in this case, we expect 10 alleles each of which was independently created by mutation. As we saw from figure 7, more than one site in a gene can result in a resistance mutation, so there are potentially many alleles created every generation due to multiple independent mutations at each site in the population. Importantly, the vast majority of cells do not have a deleterious mutation at a particular site. Moreover, the frequency of the new deleterious mutant allele is much less than 0.001%. Nonetheless, <em><strong>an allele that confers resistance exists</strong></em>. If antibiotics are not present, the mutant cell will be lost from the population because it has lower fitness than other cells. If, however, antibiotics are present, it survives. In the presence of antibiotics, the resistant cell has high fitness in the presence of antibiotics relative to the susceptible cell, but typically has low absolute fitness because growth is compromise by the mutation (Figure 9). Generation times are typically 3-10 fold longer for antibiotic resistance cells than wild type (susceptible) cells. The antibiotic resistant mutation is far from having a high growth rate. There is almost always strong selection favoring any mutation that increases the growth rate of bacteria. Thus, any mutation that increases growth rate of the resistant mutation will have a selective advantage. This is known as <u>compensatory evolution</u>.
